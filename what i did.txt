i used cosedens fil structure for client folder.
now i pasted from chatgpt the package.json of the outside level of cleint and server .so it is the third package.json independent of both foolders. it has scripts to run both client and server at same time and many more. and ran "npm i" to install devdependacies. 
added .gitignore and pasted mern stack must gitignore files.
added read.MD for instructions

now i created a server folder. 
inside it i copied the file strcuture form web dev simplified yt channell. credited him in read.MD
now i initialized package npm init -y and setup package.json



BACKEND

now we look at the plan what to do in the backend
add dev:"nodemon server.js" to scripts of package.json 

in server.js file we define a express server.

import express from "express", 
define port variable.
use express() in const app = express() for simplicity
then start by app.listen(port, callabck)

now we need to run both client and server same time using concurrently and tweaking vite.config.js for smooth experince.

now add mongodb database and connect. download it tgz file then create a mongodb and data folder in your local drive anywhere. install mongdob.tgz in mongodb folder.

you need mongod server and mongoshell or compass. so run  ~/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath ~/data/db for mongod server or set path variable to simply enabling. in this command first is path of mongod and after that option and the path data directory data/db


nowe after settign mongo db in our project we creating database config in config folder, then a different models for different purposes like for user data we created a user model so we can create(signup) search and check( login) . etc and then create a router for sginpu and login in routes folder . then separate the logic for handling the request for userRoutes in the controller folder . then do this for all other features of backend.

USE AXIOS FOR API REQUEST. not fetch

after creating login and signup backend and validation of inputs after succesful login and signup apply jwt and local storage featurea and tehn naviator to home

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
✅ 1. Signup Flow
Frontend (React):

User fills form → submits to /api/users/register

You validate fields (email, password length, etc.)

Send POST request with user data

On success:

Backend creates user + generates JWT

JWT is returned in response

✅ You store token in localStorage

✅ Show toast: “Signup successful! Welcome aboard 👋”

✅ Use useNavigate("/") to redirect to homepage

js
Copy
Edit
localStorage.setItem("token", res.data.token);
toast.success("Signup successful! Welcome aboard 👋");
navigate("/");
✅ 2. Login Flow
Frontend (React):

User fills email/password → submits to /api/users/login

You validate inputs

Backend verifies credentials and returns JWT

✅ You store token in localStorage

✅ Show toast: “Login successful!”

✅ Redirect user to homepage or dashboard

js
Copy
Edit
localStorage.setItem("token", res.data.token);
toast.success("Login successful!");
navigate("/");
🔐 3. Protecting Auth Routes (Frontend)
You’ll later:

Read the JWT from localStorage

Use it in headers for protected API calls:

js
Copy
Edit
headers: {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
}
Optionally decode it to get user info (with jwt-decode)

Create a PrivateRoute component to protect routes like /profile
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


now in backend we need to follwo this flow and on success create teh user and but we also need to validate again for backend also its a must practice.

USE OPENSSL COMMNAD TO GENREATE A JWT_SECRET (KEY) AND INSERT IT INTO ENV AND USE IT FOR JWT TOKEN CREATION. ( openssl rand -base64 32 )

now after genrating and sending jwt token in reponse in both singup and login controller, both saving the token in both login.jsx and signup.jsx we store them in local storage for proctect routes 
that needs to be proctected.

in next step we create a axiosInstance file in utils folder of frontend to get the token of the saved localstorage and send axios request to server to decode jwt and send us the users data,
so we can allow users to view their profile and access private routes.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Use axiosInstance instead of axios for protected requests:
const res = await axiosInstance.get("/users/profile");
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

next step is setting private routes 
create a privateRoute component in components folder, and use it wrap around teh proctected routes in the layout or app.jsx
here a nested object will be set inside the children array of the main object like path="/" its children array inside that we will set a object which have a element set as <PrivateRoute/> 
comonent whenever someone goes to proctected routes they will first go to lgoin if they have not lgoin or they have logined(they have valid jwt token) then they will access proctected routes.


now install jwt-decode npm package. and either create a decoder module.js in utils folder which is better since it will be used in signup too.
then we will use the data from the decoded jwt token and use the name and email from there to fill the profile details and this makes it look like the user is logged in.
this requires making the user data accessible through reactContext. we will create a context and then use its provider to provide a user varidable, a login user function and logout user 
function to all global access or whole app. by wrapping the router provider componet(our whole app in main .jsx) and then we can use the context values(user, loginuser function etc)
in any component by importing this context we created. this allows us to handle login and log out and set user details in any component needed. like we enable popup of account icon to 
show profile and dashboarf only when user is logged in and show user details. this is 2 or 3 different components work. so we need a global variable that we can use any where and we needed
loginuser and logout user in context provider because they have setUser() function which is needed to be global for us to use it anywhere and so login user and lgoout user functions needed
globalized too.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Use axiosInstance instead of axios for protected requests:
const res = await axiosInstance.get("/users/profile");
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

after this we will setup lgout feature.
