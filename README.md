## Development Notes

This project was built as part of my learning journey with the MERN stack. At the time of development, many architectural and implementation decisions were made based on my understanding and experience at that stage.

As I continued learning, I became aware of more professional patterns and best practices (such as improved validation strategies, shared schemas, and cleaner abstractions). However, refactoring the entire codebase to fully adopt these newer approaches would require significant time and restructuring, which was outside the scope of this project.

The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience by building a complete, working application end-to-end, rather than achieving perfect or enterprise-level architecture. The code reflects practical learning, iteration, and real-world problem-solving at a beginner-to-intermediate level.

This repository is intended to demonstrate growth, understanding of core concepts, and the ability to ship a functional product, rather than serving as a polished production-grade reference.
